 abstract = {Patterson & Thompson (1971) proposed estimating the variance components of a mixed analysis of variance model by maximizing the likelihood of a set of error contrasts. In the present paper, a convenient representation is obtained for that likelihood. It is shown that, from a Bayesian viewpoint, using only error contrasts to make inferences on variance components is equivalent to ignoring any prior information on the fixed effects and using all the data.},

 abstract = {A method is proposed for estimating intra-block and inter-block weights in the analysis of incomplete block designs with block sizes not necessarily equal. The method consists of maximizing the likelihood, not of all the data, but of a set of selected error contrasts. When block sizes are equal results are identical with those obtained by the method of Nelder (1968) for generally balanced designs. Although mainly concerned with incomplete block designs the paper also gives in outline an extension of the modified maximum likelihood procedure to designs with a more complicated block structure.},

 abstract = {The technique of iterative weighted linear regression can be used to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters with observations distributed according to some exponential family and systematic effects that can be made linear by a suitable transformation. A generalization of the analysis of variance is given for these models using log-likelihoods. These generalized linear models are illustrated by examples relating to four distributions; the Normal, Binomial (probit analysis, etc.), Poisson (contingency tables) and gamma (variance components). The implications of the approach in designing statistics courses are discussed.},

		  students majoring in statistics who have a solid

		  stresses the more practical uses of statistical theory,
